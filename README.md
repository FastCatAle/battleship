# Battleship - Go Edition

This is my attempt at writting this [Battleship](https://github.com/bocchidayo/Battleship) game.

The guidelines are:  
- There are 2 players
- Each player has 2 boards
- The board's size is 9x9, with coordinates A-I x 1-9
- Each player has 4 ships: 2 size 2, 1 size 3, and 1 size 4
- Ships cannot overlap or be out of bounds

For now, this is all.
